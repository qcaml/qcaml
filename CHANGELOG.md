## [0.1.6] - 2026-01-26
### Changed
- Migrating to ocaml-raylib for bloch sphere visualisation

## [0.1.5] - 2025-12-13
### Added

- T (π/8) gate
- Unit tests for S and T gates

### Changed
- Improved .gitignore to exclude .vscode directory

## [Unreleased]

### Later
- Rotation gates (Rx, Ry, Rz)
- Multi-qubit systems with tensor products
- Entangling gates (CNOT, Toffoli, SWAP)
- Circuit builder API
- QASM export functionality

## [0.1.4] - 2025-12-13
### Fixed
- macOS ARM64 support: Fixed OpenGL/GLUT header detection on Apple Silicon Macs by using /opt/homebrew/include instead of /usr/local/include
- FreeBSD compatibility: Fixed incorrect macOS detection that was breaking FreeBSD builds.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-11-2
### Changed 
- Update dune version lower bound to 3.17

## [0.1.2] - 2025-11-2
### Fixed
- Fixed a critical build failure on Windows/MinGW platforms caused by platform-specific OpenGL library naming differences.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-1
### Fixed
- Y gate test
- Type error in apply_gate.ml line 8 - Qubit.print () q returns string but Printf.printf expects a format string

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- Initial public release
- Single qubit state representation with complex amplitudes
- Qubit state constructors: `zero()`, `one()`, `plus()`, `minus()`
- Pauli gates: X, Y, Z
- Hadamard gate (H)
- Quantum measurement with probabilistic collapse
- Interactive Bloch sphere visualization using OpenGL/GLUT
- Complex number module with arithmetic operations
- Comprehensive test suite using Alcotest
- Example programs demonstrating library usage
- Apache 2.0 license

### Known Limitations
- Single-qubit operations only (no multi-qubit support)
- Limited gate set
- No circuit builder API yet
- Bloch sphere visualization can be a little buggy
