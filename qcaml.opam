synopsis: "Experimental OCaml library for quantum computing simulation"
description: """
QCaml is a lightweight OCaml library for experimenting with quantum states,
gates and measurements. It provides tools for learning quantum computing
concepts and visualizing qubit states on the Bloch sphere.

Features:
- Single qubit state representation with complex amplitudes
- Fundamental quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X/Y/Z)
- Quantum measurements with probabilistic state collapse
- Interactive Bloch sphere visualization using Raylib
- Comprehensive test suite"""
